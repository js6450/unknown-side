# Unknown Side

Unknown side is an interactive installation where people can see their shadows interact with each other's based on the position they are standing at and the distance between them. 

In Jungian psychology, the "shadow" may refer to an unconscious aspect of the personality or the entirety of the unconscious. In short, the shadow is the unknown side. Through this piece, shadow is used to open up a topic about the unrevealed sides of people and their nonverbal communication.
